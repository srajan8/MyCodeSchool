    N nodes = N-1 edges

    depth = edges between root and that node (Level)
    height = edges in longest path from that node to a leaf node

    Applications:
        file system
        quick search O(log(n))
        Trie
        Network Routing algorithm

    Binary Tree
    Array: 2, 4, 1, 6, 9, 7, 8
    - (left)2*level-1, (right)2*level
    tree node- tode
    showtree - 3 methods
    createTree
    insertTode
    deleteTode

    Balanced BT height difference left and right nodes less than k
    Complete BT
        Height of a cbt is log base2(n)
    Perfect BT
